# Test loops

| Loop | Where | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| A | 86Box on the build host (G100 + Voodoo Graphics, `bf6` board) | does it work, and does it match the Voodoo? |
| B | the physical DOS PCs (G100, G200, G450), over serial and the network | does it work on silicon, and how fast? |
| C | cuda6's G200eR2 through sysfs (read-only probes and approved MMIO) | register behaviour of real G200-family silicon |

## Loop A

`tools/loopa/run.py` builds a boot floppy and a C: disk (FreeDOS), writes
`RUN.BAT`, starts the patched 86Box under a private Xvfb, and follows the
guest's serial output (`HX-` lines from test programs, `MGL-` lines from the
runtime). It ends the emulator through the unit-tester device or a
timeout, collects `C:\OUT`, converts images to PNG, and writes
`out/<name>/{result.json,status,serial.log,*.png}`.

The machine has 64 MB unless `--mem MB` says otherwise (Half-Life on
DOS-GL runs with 128).

`--keys` types into the guest through the SDL monitor console (local patch
0101): `SECONDS:SCANCODE[:down|up]`, seconds counted from the first serial
line. An `@TEXT` item starts a new count from the moment TEXT appears on the
serial line (after the previous anchor's match): under load 86Box runs
slower than the wall clock, so a script that waits for the guest's own
lines ("the level is loaded", "saved") holds its order where fixed times
drift. `--mouse ps2` gives the machine a PS/2 mouse and loads CuteMouse
(FreeDOS 1.4's `ctmouse.zip`, fetched once) before the test; then
`SECONDS:mouse:DX:DY[:BUTTONS]` items move it by DX, DY mickeys and set its
buttons (bit 0 left, 1 right, 2 middle) through the monitor's `mouse`
command (local patch 0104, which also marks the mouse captured: 86Box's mice
report nothing otherwise). `make loopa-selftest` checks it with
`MOUSETST.EXE` (`tests/shim/mousetst.c`).

`--joystick TYPE` gives the machine a joystick (86Box's `joystick_type`,
e.g. `2axis_4button`; `4axis_4button` when `--keys` has joy items and no
type is given): a virtual one (local patch 0105, `BOX86_VJOY=1`) that
`SECONDS:joy:axis:N:VALUE` (-32767..32767) and `SECONDS:joy:button:N:0|1`
items set through the monitor's `joy` command. Axis N is the game port's
axis N (bit N of port 0x201; run.py maps the 4-axis types' rudder and
throttle straight), and 86Box adds a standalone game port when no sound
card brings one. `make loopa-selftest` checks it with `JOYTEST.EXE`
(`tests/shim/joytest.c`).

`--wav` records the sound card's output to `out/<name>/audio.wav`: 86Box
plays through OpenAL Soft, whose wave backend (`ALSOFT_DRIVERS=wave`, 16-bit)
writes the file. The wave backend keeps wall-clock time and 86Box does not,
so a recording has the guest's sounds with silences between them;
`tools/loopa/wavcheck.py FILE --tone HZ [--max-gap MS]` looks for tones in
the loud stretches. `make loopa-selftest` plays a 440 Hz tone with
`SBBEEP.EXE` (`tests/shim/sbbeep.c`, the SB DAC in direct mode) under
`--sound sb16`.

Two 16-bit helpers in `C:\HX` check that a program gave the machine back:
`KEYWAIT <seconds>` drops keys already in the BIOS buffer, prints
`HX-KEYWAIT ready`, then reports the next key read through INT 16h
(`HX-KEY scan=.. ascii=..`, or `HX-KEY none`), which shows IRQ 1 is the
BIOS's again; `VECCHK save|check` compares the real-mode vectors of IRQ 0,
1, 5, 7 and 12 and the PIC masks with a saved copy (`HX-VECCHK ok`, or one
`HX-VECCHK changed` line per difference).

Statuses: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `TIMEOUT` (wall clock), `HANG` (serial silent for
the idle time), `GUEST-EXC` (the program died and RUN.BAT carried on),
`CRASH`, `EMU-FATAL` (86Box reported a fatal error).

After every program RUN.BAT runs `VMODE`, which reports the video mode
(`HX-VMODE`), so a run shows whether the display was left in text mode.

Besides the Matrox work, the patch series fixes one CPU fault in the
emulator. Local patch `0103-cpu-restartable-interrupt-frame.patch` covers
interrupts taken at the same privilege level, as CWSDPMI's DPMI calls are:
86Box lowered ESP after each of the frame's three pushes, so a page fault
on the second or third push left ESP 4 or 8 bytes low when the INT
restarted. That happened when the frame straddled into a stack page the
program had not yet touched. DJGPP's `__dpmi_int` then popped the saved CS
into SS and died with a #GP. Whether a program hit it depended only on
where its stack happened to sit (DOS-GL's conformance tests t13 and t15
did). Real processors restore ESP. `STACKPG.EXE`
(`tests/shim/stackpg.c`, DJGPP) makes DPMI calls with ESP at every offset
around fresh page boundaries, and `make loopa-selftest` fails without the
patch.

### Machine options (for GLOS)

These options serve GLOS (`~/GLOS`), whose supervisor runs DOS in
virtual-8086 mode. None changes what an existing job generates:
`make loopa-cfgcheck` compares `run.py --emit-config` output (the 86box.cfg
with placeholder paths, RUN.BAT and the golden image key) for a set of cases
with `tools/loopa/ref/`. It needs no emulator; after a deliberate change,
`tools/loopa/cfgcheck.py --update` rewrites the references for review.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--machine bf6\|486dx2\|486dx4` | `bf6` is the Pentium II 350 above. The 486 profiles are a Shuttle HOT-433A (UMC 8881, PCI, AwardBIOS 4.51PG) with an i486DX2-66 (no CR4, no CPUID) or an Intel iDX4-100 (CR4 with VME and PVI). Each profile has its own NVRAM cache. |
| `--card vbe` | An S3 Trio64V2/DX with its "Generic" BIOS (VBE 2.0, 4 MB, linear framebuffer). The default on the 486 profiles: 86Box's Matrox cards are AGP, so a Matrox card there is a setup error. `VBEINFO` reports the VBE version, memory and modes. |
| `--boot-cfg himemx` | A boot floppy with `DEVICE=HIMEMX.EXE` and `DOS=HIGH` (`tools/loopa/mkgolden-variant.sh`; HIMEMX pinned from the FreeDOS 1.4 repository). The default floppy and its key are untouched. `XMSINFO` reports the XMS driver and whether DOS is in the HMA. |
| `--net CARD` | A network card on SLiRP (`ne2k` ISA at 300h IRQ 10, `ne2kpci`, `rtl8139c+`, `i82557`, `i82558`) with host TCP ports forwarded into the guest: `--net-fwd [HOST:]GUEST`, default guest port 22 on a free host port, recorded in `result.json`. `--net-dos` puts the Crynwr NE2000 packet driver and mTCP's DHCP and NC on C:. |
| `--com2` | COM2 on a pty (86Box's named-pipe device opens it directly) that run.py relays to a TCP port on 127.0.0.1 (`result.json` `com2_port`; the guest's output also goes to `com2.log`): the route for a gdb stub in the guest. |
| `--tcp-send ANCHOR\|TARGET\|TEXT` | Once ANCHOR is on the serial line, connects to TARGET (`com2` or `net:GUESTPORT`), sends TEXT and CR LF, and keeps the reply in `tcp-N.txt`. |
| `--wrap PREFIX` | Puts PREFIX in front of the program's command line (`GLOS.EXE /RUN ...`). |
| `--dynarec 0` | Runs 86Box's interpreter instead of the dynamic recompiler. |

`make loopa-selftest-ext` (`tools/loopa/selftest_ext.py`; `CHECKS="486 vbe"`
picks some) checks them:

| Check | What passes |
|---|---|
| `486` | HELLO and STACKPG on both 486 profiles |
| `vbe` | VBE 2.0 with a linear 640x480x16 mode on the BF6 and the 486dx2 |
| `net` | The host's text reaching mTCP NC listening on the guest's port 22 through the forward |
| `com2` | `COM2ECHO` echoing a line from the bridge |
| `himemx` | XMS 3.0 with DOS high, then HELLO and STACKPG |
| `cpu` | V86TEST on all three profiles |

**V86TEST** (`tests/cpu/`) is a CPU self-test for the paths a virtual-8086
monitor depends on.
- A 16-bit loader runs the real-mode cases: the BIOS's INT 15h 86h against the
  RTC, and the A20 methods.
- It then enters protected mode with paging and calls a 32-bit monitor (host
  `gcc -m32`, `V86PM.BIN`). The monitor checks, against silicon behaviour:
  - V86 entry and exit;
  - IOPL-sensitive instructions;
  - INT3, INTO and BOUND;
  - the I/O bitmap;
  - VME and PVI;
  - gate checks and ESP0;
  - the 16-bit-SS ESP leak;
  - bad IRET frames;
  - page-fault error codes;
  - global pages;
  - the RTC rate;
  - FPU error reporting;
  - IOPL changes under the dynarec.

It found six places where 86Box differed. Local patches fix them:
- **0106:** a VME-redirected INT pushes IF = VIF and IOPL = 3.
- **0107:** INT3 and INTO in V86 mode go through the IDT.
- **0108:** the redirection bitmap applies at IOPL 3.
- **0109:** POPFD never loads VIF or VIP.
- **0110:** a byte port's two bitmap bytes must be inside the TSS limit.

`tests/cpu/known-86box.txt` lists any remaining deviation the check accepts.
It is empty; the RTC firing with register C unread and PGE having no effect
are recorded as INFO.

### Conformance (`tools/conform/run.py`)

`ref` runs a test on the retail runtime and the emulated Voodoo and stores
its frames in `tests/conform/ref/voodoo/<test>/`; `check` runs it on
MGA-Glide and the emulated G100 and compares (`tools/imgcmp.py`: 565
quantisation, per-channel tolerance, fraction of pixels allowed beyond it,
edge masking). `tests/conform/manifest.json` holds per-test and per-frame
tolerances, box filtering for G100 stipple, `ignore` rectangles for
documented reference-card gaps, and per-cell gating for the combine grid.

### Games

`--game gta|sr` attaches the installed game (from `~/DOSGAMES`) as D:,
with keys and screenshots on a timetable. `SET MGAGLIDE=...` in `--pre`
sets runtime options (for example `exit_after`, `stats`, `census`,
`trace`). Call traces replayed with GLPLAY on both paths give the REPLAY
comparison (`tools/games/replay.py`, see `docs/trace.md`).

## Loop B

See `docs/bench.md` for the bench layout and provisioning checklist.

## Loop C

`tools/rig/` holds the cuda6 probes, which stay within the approved scope:
`/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:0a:00.0/*`, `~/mga-rig/` and `gdb`.
