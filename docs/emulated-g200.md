# The emulated G200 (86Box local patch 0004)

86Box emulates the Matrox G100 but not the G200. Patch
`tools/86box/patches/local/0004-mga-g200.patch` adds a "Matrox Millennium
G200 (MGA-Glide emulation)" AGP device (`millennium_g200`) so the G200 code
paths of the runtime can be developed and tested before the physical G200
and cuda6 checks (PRD WP-3, milestone M5). Like every 86Box change in this
project it is local and never upstreamed (PRD D4).

Select it with `--card g200` (or `MGA_CARD=g200`) in `tools/loopa/run.py`
and `tools/conform/run.py`.

## What it adds to the G100 model

| Area | Behaviour | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | PCI device `0x0521`, family G200 | Matrox PCI IDs (public) |
| Video BIOS | Matrox's G200 AGP BIOS 900-33 (VBE 3.0), unpacked from Matrox's public `setup257.exe` into the local ROM set by `tools/86box/build.sh` (patch `0007`; never committed). Fallback, or with `MGAGLIDE_G200_BIOS=g100`: the Productiva G100 BIOS with its PCI data structure and three device-ID checks rewritten to `0x0521` at load | Matrox BIOS package (pinned by sha256 in `tools/setup/versions.mk`); the G100 fallback's rewrites were measured: without them it never programs the DAC depth |
| Origins | `DSTORG` moves the colour buffer (in bytes); `ZORG` is absolute | Matrox G200 register documentation, as used by the X.org and Mesa drivers |
| Blending | `ALPHACTRL` source and destination factors, in `TRAP` and `TEXTURE_TRAP`; destination alpha is 255 in 16 bpp | same |
| Alpha test | `ALPHACTRL.aten`, `atmode`, `atref` on the selected alpha | same |
| Specular | `TEXCTL2.specen` adds the iterated `SPECR/G/B` colour after texturing | same |
| Decal blend | `TEXCTL2.decalblend` blends texel and diffuse by texel alpha | same |
| Mipmaps | `TEXORG1..4`, `TEXFILTER.mapnb` and the `mm*` minification modes; the level comes from the per-pixel coordinate gradients and the nearest-level modes round it | Rounding measured on the cuda6 G200eR2 (`docs/loop-c-results.md`, E5) |
| `DWGSYNC` | reads back the last value written | same register documentation |

With the genuine BIOS, PROBE reports VBE 3.0 and the real LFB address in
every mode entry (the G100 BIOS reported `fffffff0`), `OPTION=4007dd21`
and subsystem ID 0 (the package image carries no board subsystem bytes at
`7FF8h`). The DAC state after the mode set (`HX-STAT dac`, `HX-STAT crtc`)
is identical under both BIOSes; the conformance suite and both game
replays pass unchanged.

Patch `0010-mga-tlut-rstr.patch` (all cards) loads the texture lookup
table from a BITBLT with atype RSTR as well as RPL: the G200 and G400
specifications' recipe uses RSTR, which upstream drew into VRAM instead.
The HAL's `engine_tlut_load()` follows the specifications; DOS-GL uses the
table for 8-bit paletted textures (TW8) on the G200.

ILOAD (`engine_iload_begin/row/end`, G200 and later; DOS-GL writes
`glTexSubImage2D` rectangles with it) works in the unpatched model, with two
conditions:

- The data goes through the DMA window, and the model accepts it only while
  `OPMODE.dmamod` is BLIT, as the specification requires. The HAL sets that
  once.
- The model ignores `DWGCTL.clipdis`, so the HAL also opens the clip
  registers for the load and restores them after it.

Whether the texture cache sees texels written by ILOAD is silicon
experiment E6 (DOS-GL `docs/silicon-experiments.md`).

Patch `0011-mga-display-zoom-and-flip.patch` (all cards) fixes three display
details the resolution work (`vbe_plan_mode`, `vbe_set_zoom`,
`engine_present`) depends on:

- **Pixel doubling.** In power-graphics mode, XZOOMCTRL hzoom 2x now shows
  each pixel twice. Upstream stored the register and did nothing, and its
  generic "low-res" renderers do not double pixels on the modern render
  path, so the card has its own renderer for 15/16 and 32 bpp. Line
  doubling through CRTC9's maxscan already worked. 4x zoom, and zoom at 8
  or 24 bpp, are logged as unsupported.
- **Page flips at 1024x768 and above.** A new display start that changes
  only CRTCEXT0's high address bits (the second page of 1024x768 and
  1280x1024 lands on a 64 KB boundary) now redraws the whole screen, as a
  CRTC 0Ch/0Dh change always did. Before, the emulator kept showing the
  previous page's lines until they changed.
- **Horizontal blanking.** The Matrox blanking end is a 7-bit field (CRTC3,
  CRTC5 bit 7, CRTCEXT1 bit 6), but 86Box's generic code compares only 6
  bits unless the value has a higher bit set, so the G100 BIOS's 1600x1200
  mode ended blanking 64 clocks early and showed a 512-pixel phantom left
  border. Blanking start bit 8 (CRTCEXT1 bit 1) was also always read as 0.

`tests/hal/scale.c` checks both, against the unit tester's picture of the
monitor. Real cards are unaffected by the second fix; the first is the model
of a documented register, to be confirmed on each card at the bench.

Known gap: with 8 MB configured, the genuine BIOS reports **2 MB** as VBE
`TotalMemory` (DOS-GL's PROBE: `vram=2097152`), so it presumably sizes
memory from something the model does not provide. MGA-Glide never
noticed, because it sizes VRAM with `mga_probe_vram()`; DOS-GL did (a 248 KB
texture heap) and now probes too. Check what the real G200 BIOS reports at
milestone S before changing the model.

Patch `0005-mga-texel-alpha.patch` (both cards) gives TW15 texels their
1-bit alpha and expands TW12 fields by bit replication; patch
`0006-mga-measured-texturing.patch` makes the larger-weight texel decide
colour keys under bilinear filtering and rounds the mip level. All three
behaviours were then confirmed on the G200eR2 (Loop C).

## Checked on the G200eR2 (Loop C)

Texel expansion, TW15 alpha, blend arithmetic, blending in plain `TRAP`,
mip level rounding and colour keys under bilinear filtering: see
`docs/loop-c-results.md`. Still unchecked: large `fthres` values, the
two-level (trilinear) modes, `DSTORG` alignment rules, and anything that
might differ between the G200eR2 and a retail G200 (Loop B).
